                        With the constant evolution of technology, software development has become a complex and ever-changing field. It is important to ensure that the latest best practices are being followed in order to get the best outcomes. However, there are some practices that have become conventional but are actually useless. These should be avoided if possible, as they may not help produce the most efficient results <br>
                        Although some approaches to software development have been established as standard, it is a good idea to take a closer look at them and consider if they are really as reliable as we think. For example, in a project that requires database integration, there is often a tendency to use the most popular database management system regardless of the specific needs of the project. While this can provide some assurance that the system will be reliable, it may not be the most efficient solution<br>
                        Another seemingly necessary part of software development is documentation. This can be useful in terms of keeping track of changes and providing instruction to new team members. However, the problem is that too much documentation can lead to an excessive amount of time being spent on updating the documents rather than working on the code. In this case, it would be better to only document the more complex elements of the project<br>
                        A third practice that is often used in software development is prototyping. While this can be beneficial in terms of testing out ideas before moving forward with a large-scale project, it can be time consuming and costly if done without considering the cost/benefit ratio. Instead of prototyping the entire software solution, try prototyping only the most essential elements<br>
                        Finally, one of the most conventional practices in software development is the use of coding libraries. While they can provide an easy way to integrate common functionality into a project, they can be limiting if the library doesn't contain the features needed for the project. Additionally, the library may not be up-to-date on the latest technology and could cause serious security issue.<br>

                        In cnclusion, conventional practices in software development should not be blindly followed. It is important to consider the cost/benefit ratio and the specific needs of the project before involving any particular approach. By avoiding these seemingly necessary but actually useless practices, software development can be done more efficiently and cost-effectively.
